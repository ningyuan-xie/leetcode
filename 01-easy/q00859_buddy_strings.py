"""859. Buddy Strings
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/buddy-strings/
Difficulty: Easy
Description: Given two strings s and goal, return true if you can swap two letters in s so the result is equal to goal, otherwise, return false.
Swapping letters is defined as taking two indices i and j (0-indexed) such that i != j and swapping the characters at s[i] and s[j].
â€¢ For example, swapping at indices 0 and 2 in "abcd" results in "cbad"."""
