"""3512. Minimum Operations to Make Array Sum Divisible by K
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-operations-to-make-array-sum-divisible-by-k/
Difficulty: Easy
Description: You are given an integer array nums and an integer k. You can perform the following operation any number of times:
â€¢ Select an index i and replace nums[i] with nums[i] - 1.
Return the minimum number of operations required to make the sum of the array divisible by k."""
