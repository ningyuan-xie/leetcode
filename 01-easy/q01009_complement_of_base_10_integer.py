"""1009. Complement of Base 10 Integer
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/complement-of-base-10-integer/
Difficulty: Easy
Description: The complement of an integer is the integer you get when you flip all the 0's to 1's and all the 1's to 0's in its binary representation.
â€¢ For example, The integer 5 is "101" in binary and its complement is "010" which is the integer 2.
Given an integer n, return its complement."""
