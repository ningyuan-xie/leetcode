"""509. Fibonacci Number
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/fibonacci-number/
Difficulty: Easy
Description: The Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted F(n) form a sequence, called
the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones,
starting from 0 and 1. That is, F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1, F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2) for n > 1.
Given n, calculate F(n)."""
