"""121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/
Difficulty: Easy
Description: You are given an array prices where prices[i] is
the price of a given stock on the ith day.
You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock
and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock."""
