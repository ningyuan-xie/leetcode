"""141. Linked List Cycle
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/
Difficulty: Easy
Description: Given head, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.
There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by
continuously following the next pointer."""
