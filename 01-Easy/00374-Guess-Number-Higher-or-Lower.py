"""374. Guess Number Higher or Lower
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/guess-number-higher-or-lower/
Difficulty: Easy
Description: We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:
I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.
Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number is higher or lower."""

    """Mock function for guessing the number: Assume the number that I picked is 6"""

    if num == picked:
        return 0
    elif num < picked:
        return 1
    else:
        return -1
