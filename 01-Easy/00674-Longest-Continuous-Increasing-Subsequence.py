"""671. Longest Continuous Increasing Subsequence
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-continuous-increasing-subsequence/
Difficulty: Easy
Description: Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest
continuous (i.e. subarray). The subarray must be strictly increasing."""
