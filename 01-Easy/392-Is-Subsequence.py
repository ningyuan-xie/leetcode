"""394. Is Subsequence
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/is-subsequence/
Difficulty: Easy
Description: Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.
A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by
deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of
the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not)."""
