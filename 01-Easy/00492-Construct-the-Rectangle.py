"""492. Construct the Rectangle
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-the-rectangle/
Difficulty: Easy
Description: A web developer needs to know how to design a web page's size.
So, given a specific rectangular web pageâ€™s area, your job by now is to design a
rectangular web page, whose length L and width W satisfy the following requirements:
1. The area of the rectangular web page you designed must equal to the given target area.
2. The width W should not be larger than the length L, which means L >= W.
3. The difference between length L and width W should be as small as possible.
Return an array [L, W] where L and W are the length and width of the web page you
designed in sequence."""

            if area % width == 0:
