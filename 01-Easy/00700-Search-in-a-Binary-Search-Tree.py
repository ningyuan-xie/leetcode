"""700. Search in a Binary Search Tree
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-a-binary-search-tree/
Difficulty: Easy
Description: You are given the root of a binary search tree (BST) and an integer val.
Find the node in the BST that the node's value equals val and return the subtree rooted with that node.
If such a node does not exist, return null."""
