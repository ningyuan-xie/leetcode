"""401. Binary Watch
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-watch/
Difficulty: Easy
Description: A binary watch has 4 LEDs on the top which represent the hours (0-11),
and the 6 LEDs on the bottom represent the minutes (0-59).
Each LED represents a zero or one, with the least significant bit on the right.
Given a non-negative integer n which represents the number of LEDs that are currently on,
return all possible times the watch could represent."""
