"""405. Convert a Number to Hexadecimal
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-a-number-to-hexadecimal/
Difficulty: Easy
Description: Given an integer num, return a string representing its hexadecimal representation.
For negative integers, twoâ€™s complement method is used. For example:
-1 = 2^32 - 1 = 4294967295 = 0xffffffff; -2 = 2^32 - 2 = 4294967294 = 0xfffffffe"""
