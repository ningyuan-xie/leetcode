"""412. Fizz Buzz
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/fizz-buzz/
Difficulty: Easy
Description: Given an integer n, return a string array answer (1-indexed) where:
- answer[i] == "FizzBuzz" if i is divisible by 3 and 5.
- answer[i] == "Fizz" if i is divisible by 3.
- answer[i] == "Buzz" if i is divisible by 5.
- answer[i] == i (as a string) if none of the above conditions are true."""
