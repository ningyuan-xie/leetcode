"""441. Arranging Coins
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/arranging-coins/
Difficulty: Easy
Description: You have n coins, and you want to build a staircase with these coins.
The staircase consists of k rows where the ith row has exactly i coins.
The last row of the staircase may be incomplete.
Given the integer n, return the number of complete rows of the staircase you will build."""
