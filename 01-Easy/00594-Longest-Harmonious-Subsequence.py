"""594. Longest Harmonious Subsequence
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-harmonious-subsequence/
Difficulty: Easy
Description: We define a harmonious array as an array where the difference between its maximum value
and its minimum value is exactly 1.
Given an integer array nums, return the length of its longest harmonious subsequence among all
its possible subsequences.
A subsequence of array is a sequence that can be derived from the array by deleting some or no
elements without changing the order of the remaining elements."""
