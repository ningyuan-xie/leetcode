"""69. Sqrt(x)
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/sqrtx/
Difficulty: Easy
Description: Given a non-negative integer x, return the square root of x rounded down to the nearest integer. The returned integer should be non-negative as well.
You must not use any built-in exponent function or operator.
â€¢ For example, do not use pow(x, 0.5) in c++ or x ** 0.5 in python."""
