"""495. Teemo Attacking
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/teemo-attacking/
Difficulty: Easy
Our hero Teemo is attacking an enemy Ashe with poison attacks!
When Teemo attacks Ashe, Ashe gets poisoned for an exact duration seconds.
More formally, an attack at second t will mean Ashe is poisoned during the
inclusive time interval [t, t + duration - 1].
If Teemo attacks again before the poison effect ends, the timer for it is reset,
and the poison effect will end duration seconds after the new attack.
You are given a non-decreasing integer array timeSeries, where timeSeries[i] denotes that
Teemo attacks Ashe at second timeSeries[i], and an integer duration.
Return the total number of seconds that Ashe is poisoned."""
