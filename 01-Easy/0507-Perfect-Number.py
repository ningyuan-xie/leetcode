"""507. Perfect Number
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/perfect-number/
Difficulty: Easy
Description: A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its positive
divisors, excluding itself. A divisor of an integer x is an integer that can divide x evenly.
Given an integer n, return true if n is a perfect number, otherwise return false."""
