"""543. Diameter of Binary Tree
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/diameter-of-binary-tree/
Difficulty: Easy
Description: Given the root of a binary tree, return the length of the diameter of the tree.
The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree.
This path may or may not pass through the root."""
