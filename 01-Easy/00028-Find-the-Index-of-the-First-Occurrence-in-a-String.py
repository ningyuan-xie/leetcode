"""28. Find the Index of the First Occurrence in a String
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-index-of-the-first-occurrence-in-a-string/
Difficulty: Easy
Description: Given two strings needle and haystack,
return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack,
or -1 if needle is not part of haystack."""
