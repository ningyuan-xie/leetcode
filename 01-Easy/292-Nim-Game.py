"""292. Nim Game
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/nim-game/
Difficulty: Easy
Description: You are playing the following Nim Game with your friend:
Initially, there is a heap of stones on the table.
You and your friend will alternate taking turns, and you go first.
On each turn, the person whose turn it is will remove 1 to 3 stones from the heap.
The one who removes the last stone is the winner."""
