"""551. Student Attendance Record I
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/student-attendance-record-i/
Difficulty: Easy
Description: You are given a string representing an attendance record for a student
where each character signifies whether the student was absent, late, or present on that day.
The record only contains the following three characters:
'A': Absent.'L': Late. 'P': Present.
The student is eligible for an attendance award if they meet both of the following criteria:
The student was absent ('A') for strictly fewer than 2 days total.
The student was never late ('L') for 3 or more consecutive days.
Return true if the student is eligible for an attendance award, or false otherwise."""
