"""506. Relative Ranks
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/relative-ranks/
Difficulty: Easy
Description: You are given an integer array score of size n, where score[i] is the
score of the ith athlete in a competition. All the scores are guaranteed to be unique.
Return an array answer of size n where answer[i] is the ith athlete's rank."""
