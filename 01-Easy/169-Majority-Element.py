"""169. Majority Element
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element/
Difficulty: Easy
Description: Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.
The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times.
Follow-up: Could you solve the problem in linear time and in O(1) space?"""
