"""278. First Bad Version
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/first-bad-version/
Difficulty: Easy
Description: You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product.
Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check.
Since each version is developed based on the previous version,
all the versions after a bad version are also bad.
Suppose you have n versions [1, 2, ..., n] and you want to find out the first bad one,
which causes all the following ones to be bad.
You are given an API bool isBadVersion(version) which returns whether version is bad.
Implement a function to find the first bad version.
You should minimize the number of calls to the API."""


def isBadVersion(version: int) -> bool:
    """ Mock API function: Assume bad version starts from 4"""
    return version >= 4


class Solution:
    @staticmethod
    def firstBadVersion(n: int) -> int:
        """Optimal Solution: Binary Search. Time Complexity: O(log(n)), Space Complexity: O(1).
           Similar to 0069-Sqrt(x).py and 0367-Valid-Perfect-Square.py"""
        # Initialize the left and right pointers
        left, right = 1, n
        # Perform binary search to find the first bad version
        while left <= right:
            mid = left + (right - left) // 2

            # If the middle version is not bad, move the left pointer to the right
            if not isBadVersion(mid):
                left = mid + 1
            # Otherwise, move the right pointer to the left
            else:
                right = mid - 1
        # Can return either left or right since they are equal
        return left


# Input: n = 5, bad = 4, Output: 4. Explanation: The first bad version is 4
assert Solution.firstBadVersion(5) == 4

# Input: n = 10, bad = 4, Output: 4. Explanation: The first bad version is 4
assert Solution.firstBadVersion(10) == 4
