"""38. Count and Say
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/count-and-say/
Difficulty: Medium
Description: The count-and-say sequence is a sequence of digit strings defined by the recursive
formula: countAndSay(1) = "1", countAndSay(2) = "11", countAndSay(3) = "21",
countAndSay(4) = "1211", ...
countAndSay(n) is the way you would "say" the digit string from countAndSay(n-1)."""
